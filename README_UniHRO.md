This is a Firmware for the Delta printer at the University of Rostock (Germany)

- It only supports the hardware installed on our machine
- It is less (not at all) flexible than the normal Marlin
- It doesn't support LCD displays, different Boards, etc
- It is only intended to be used by the Uni Rostock for easy readability 
  and easy troubleshooting by non proffesional programmers

- It doesn't contain any improvements on the general Marlin Firmware until further notice!

- If you still wish to use this Firmware or contribute to this MarlinBasic firmware feel free to do so.
